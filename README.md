# Jeopardy
> Create a version of the hit game 'Jeopardy'.


The assignment for Front End Engineering Class 1810, Module 2, at Turing School of Software and Design was to create a modified version of 'Jeopardy' using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It should also use a testing suite using Mocha and Chai, as well as demonstrate Object Oriented Programming and Class principles. The design should include three players and two rounds, including a 'Daily Double' special state.
